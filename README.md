# Mp3 list

![Demo](http://i.andrewradev.com/c468fc99ffc544e766a9a51364c55154.png)

A very basic [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) app for teaching purposes. Might be extended with more stuff at a later time, might not be.

Can be executed with `cargo run --features persistence` to remember its visual layout, root dir and filter query.
